              Abdul Sattar Edhi was a prominent Pakistani philanthropist and humanitarian who dedicated his life to helping the less fortunate and marginalized members of society. Born on January 1, 1928, in Gujarat, British India (now in Pakistan), Edhi's journey towards philanthropy began at a young age when he witnessed the suffering of the poor and needy around him.

              In 1951, he established the Edhi Foundation, which later became one of the largest and most organized social welfare systems in Pakistan. The foundation's primary focus was to provide medical aid, shelter, and care for orphans, abandoned children, and the destitute. Edhi's selfless and hands-on approach to his work made him a beloved figure among the Pakistani people.

              Throughout his life, Edhi never sought recognition or financial gain for his efforts. He lived a very modest life and considered himself a simple man with a deep sense of compassion for those in need. He used to say, "No religion is higher than humanity," a sentiment that reflected his inclusive and universal approach to helping people regardless of their background or beliefs.
